# BUG #1: Event Update Failure from Events List - ✅ FIXED

## Original Issue
I try to update the description of an event from event list page, after I updated the description. When click on Update Event. i got following error:

**Error Log:**
```
events.js?v=3c9b9d57:760 Edit event: 05ec4762-7445-46a9-bb18-9bda7b996028
[... successful EventsPage processing ...]
events.js?v=3c9b9d57:189 [EVENTS.JS] Executing handleEditEvent from save button
events.js?v=3c9b9d57:880 [EVENTS.JS] handleEditEvent called {currentEditEvent: '05ec4762-7445-46a9-bb18-9bda7b996028', eventExists: true}
event-detail.js?v=3c9b9d57:1546 [EVENT-DETAIL.JS] handleEditEvent called {currentEvent: undefined, eventExists: false}
event-detail.js?v=3c9b9d57:1552 [EVENT-DETAIL.JS] handleEditEvent called but no event is currently being edited
events.js?v=3c9b9d57:917 Failed to update event: Error: Failed to update event
```

## Root Cause
Both EventsPage and EventDetailPage were attaching event listeners to the same DOM element (`#edit-event-save`), causing duplicate handler execution. When updating from Events list:
1. EventsPage handler executes correctly with `this.currentEditEvent`
2. EventDetailPage handler also fires but fails because it expects `this.currentEvent` 
3. EventsPage receives the failure from EventDetailPage

## Solution - Fixed in commit `8e8d8f9`
Added page context checking in EventDetailPage event handlers:
- Only execute handleEditEvent() when event-detail page is visible
- Check `eventDetailPage.classList.contains('hidden')` before handling
- Prevents cross-page event handler conflicts

**Files Changed:** `public/js/pages/event-detail.js`

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
- Event updates from Events list page now work correctly
- Event updates from Event detail page continue working  
- All 309 unit tests pass
- No duplicate handler execution

## User Note from Original Bug Report
*"Note that if I try to do the same change by edit the event from event details page. I don't see this error. Please when fix this error, check if the logic is shared in the event detail page's update event modal. Since the logic is same, there shouldn't be duplicated."*

**Analysis:** The user was correct - the logic was duplicated but conflicting. Both pages had separate `handleEditEvent` methods that were being called for the same DOM element. The fix ensures only the active page's handler executes while preserving both implementations for their respective contexts.
