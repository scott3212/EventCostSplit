# Cypress E2E Test Suite

## Test Structure Overview

The Cypress test suite has been organized into focused, production-quality tests that provide comprehensive coverage of the Badminton Cost Splitter application.

### 📂 Test Organization

### 🚀 Enhanced Testing Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Expense Management E2E Tests
```cypress
- expense-management/
  ├── expense-crud.cy.js                # Expense creation, editing, deletion
  ├── expense-split-scenarios.cy.js     # Custom split percentage testing
  └── expense-validation.cy.js          # Form validation and error handling
```

#### Phase 2: Advanced Integration Tests
```cypress
- integration/
  ├── event-expense-flow.cy.js          # Event → Add expenses → Calculate splits
  ├── settlement-workflows.cy.js        # Complex multi-user settlement scenarios
  └── balance-calculations.cy.js        # Cross-event balance validation
```

#### Phase 3: Performance & Edge Cases
```cypress
- performance/
  ├── large-dataset.cy.js               # Test with many users/events/expenses
  └── concurrent-operations.cy.js       # Multi-user scenario simulation
- edge-cases/
  ├── boundary-values.cy.js             # Min/max values, edge cases
  └── error-recovery.cy.js              # Network failures, recovery scenarios
```

### 🛠️ Custom Commands Available

Located in `cypress/support/commands.js`:

- `cy.clearApplicationData()` - Clear all test data
- `cy.createUser(userData)` - Create test user via API
- `cy.createEvent(eventData)` - Create test event via API
- `cy.createExpense(expenseData)` - Create test expense via API
- `cy.navigateToPage(pageName)` - Navigate to specific SPA page
- `cy.waitForApiSuccess(alias)` - Wait for successful API response
- `cy.submitForm(formSelector, data)` - Fill and submit forms
- `cy.shouldContainText(text)` - Chainable text assertion
- `cy.shouldShowBalance(amount)` - Financial amount validation

### 📊 Current Test Metrics

- **8 test files** (down from 16 after cleanup)
- **Comprehensive coverage** of all major features
- **Production-ready** test structure
- **Maintainable** organization with clear separation of concerns

### 🎯 Next Steps for Enhanced E2E Testing

1. **Create Expense Management Tests** - Fill the gap in expense workflow testing
2. **Add Advanced Integration Scenarios** - Multi-step business workflows
3. **Implement Performance Testing** - Large dataset and stress testing
4. **Add API Error Simulation** - Network failure and recovery testing
5. **Create Visual Regression Tests** - UI consistency validation

### 🔧 Running Tests

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test file
npm run cypress:run -- --spec "cypress/e2e/event-management/event-crud.cy.js"

# Run tests in browser mode (development)
npm run cypress:open
```

### 🎉 Benefits of Clean Structure

- **Faster development** - No time wasted on redundant tests
- **Clear organization** - Easy to find and maintain tests
- **Focused coverage** - Each test has a specific purpose
- **Professional quality** - Production-ready test suite
- **Enhanced reliability** - No debug or temporary test code
