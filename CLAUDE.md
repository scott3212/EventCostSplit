# Claude Code Session Context

## Project Overview
**Badminton Event Cost Splitter** - A simple expense-splitting web application for badminton events that allows users to create events, add participants, track expenses, and calculate balances.

## User Requirements Summary

### Initial Requirements
- Local app (no login required) for organizing badminton events
- Support multiple events with different participants and spending
- Even cost splitting by default among event participants  
- Proper calculation ensuring person who paid still owes their share
- Local file storage (CSV or JSON) - no database initially
- Simple web interface

### Core Features Needed
- **User Management**: Add users with UUID, name, email (optional), phone (optional)
- **Event Creation**: Create events with participants from user pool
- **Cost Tracking**: Add expenses with description, amount, paidBy, date
- **Balance Calculation**: Track who owes what across all events
- **Settlement Tracking**: Record when payments are made to organizer

### Additional Requirements Clarified
1. **Payment System**: Users pay directly to organizer/shared pot (not each other)
2. **Partial Cost Participation**: Support excluding users from specific cost items or custom split percentages
3. **Cross-Event Balance**: Track total balance across all events
4. **Top-up Support**: Allow advance payments
5. **Audit Trail**: Full transaction history for all payments and cost modifications
6. **Settlement vs Top-up**: Both are technically identical (add to user balance) - difference is just for audit/description purposes
7. **User Experience Priority**: App must be extremely user-friendly with minimal learning curve - intuitive for non-technical users

### Key Design Decisions Made

#### Data Structure Approach
- **JSON files** chosen over CSV (more flexible for nested data)
- **splitPercentage** system where all participants' percentages sum to 100% (easier calculation)
- **Unified payment** system (removed type distinction, kept optional event linking for audit)

#### Split Percentage Examples
- 3 people: 33.33%, 33.33%, 33.34% (default equal split)
- Custom: 40%, 35%, 25% (must sum to 100%)
- Exclusion: 0% for excluded participant

#### Technical Simplifications
- Payments are technically identical regardless of purpose
- Optional `relatedEventId` for audit trail only
- Description field allows user to specify purpose

## Example Business Scenario
**Event**: 6 people signed up for badminton session
**Cost Item 1**: Court Rental $60 - all 6 people pay equally (16.67% each = $10 each)
**Cost Item 2**: Shuttlecocks $30 - Bob excluded (0%), remaining 5 people pay equally (20% each = $6 each)
**Result**: Bob owes $10 (court only), others owe $16 each (court + shuttlecocks)

## File Structure Decided
```
data/
├── users.json          // User profiles with balances
├── events.json         // Event details with participants  
├── cost_items.json     // Expenses with splitPercentage config
└── payments.json       // All payments (settlements + top-ups)
```

## Technology Stack Selected
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + File System operations
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (vanilla) + Bootstrap
- **Storage**: JSON files (no database initially)
- **ID Generation**: uuid library

## Key UI Design Elements
- **Dashboard**: Quick stats, recent activities, quick actions
- **Events Page**: List + detailed event view with cost items

## Important Notes for Implementation
- Default split: Equal percentages (100 ÷ participant count)
- All split percentages must sum to exactly 100%
- Person who paid still owes their calculated share
- Payments are technically identical regardless of description/purpose
- Full audit trail required for all transactions
- UI should be intuitive for split percentage configuration
- Balance calculations happen across ALL events globally

## User Experience Requirements (CRITICAL)
- **Zero Learning Curve**: App should be immediately intuitive to anyone
- **Clear Visual Feedback**: Every action should have immediate, clear feedback
- **Guided Workflows**: Step-by-step guidance for complex operations
- **Error Prevention**: Prevent user mistakes before they happen
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for phone usage during events
- **Minimal Clicks**: Reduce steps needed to complete common tasks
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-fill forms with sensible defaults
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Most important actions prominently displayed
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Clear confirmations for destructive actions
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show advanced features only when needed

## Key Validation Rules
- Split percentages must sum to 100% exactly
- Only event participants can be assigned cost item splits
- Payment amounts must be positive
- User names must be unique
- Event participants must be existing users

## Implementation Decisions Made
- ✅ Split percentages sum to exactly 100% with proper rounding
- ✅ Validation happens on both client and server side
- ✅ Referential integrity handled through service layer validation
- ✅ User-friendly confirmation dialogs designed
- ✅ Full audit trail implemented with timestamps

## UX Decisions Implemented
